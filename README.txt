I built my program in Jupyter Notebook so I included that and also a .py file.

The notebook should run fine if you just run every cell. There are several functions with the main one at the bottom.

To play the game you have to enter 2 numbers based on the grid to make your move. There is a reference sheet in the notebook but something like 10 would place your mark on the left middle space. You can also input "xx" to end the game in the middle.

The text files are where the data from past games is stored so they need to be in the same place as the program.

Required files:
aiData
aiWins
gameData
